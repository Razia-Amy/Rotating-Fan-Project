# Rotating-Fan-Project
This is a Project on Computer Graphics.

In this mini-project we have demonstrated the Rotation of Fan by using OpenGL and the model is designed with C++ code. OpenGL is a freely available Computer Graphics operating system. Here we use header files of, OpenGL is an interactive environment. From this project we can learn about open gl and how it performs in multiple task on it using input from keyboard.
